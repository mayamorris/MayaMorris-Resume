        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Maya Morris and I am majoring in Education, Society, and Human Development. Additionally, I am minoring in Sociology. I entered the School of Education at the University of California, Riverside because I initially wanted to advocate for student equity in the educational field. I did this concurrently on a pre-med track because I wanted to become a provider in the medical field as well. However, through years of uncertainty, curiosity, and change of interests, I started to explore more options of what I wished to do in the future (career wise). I grew uo wanted to help individuals, but never quite knew the environment or capacity I wanted to achieve this goal in. I switched interests in my undergraduate years from pre-med to public health to, now, social work and advocacy. Moreover, my drive to help others never dulled, yet it remains to be known where this will take me. However, with the mentorship and help from staff, faculty, and colleagues, I have been able to develop a better understanding of where my life can go. Needless to say, my options seem to be endless and I am excited to explore them more. <br><br>

        In school, there are several things that I participated in that helped me stay engaged (socially), but that also prepared me for a life of experience. One of the first organizations I joined was the Black Student Union. Being connected to my culture is something that is extremely important to me and I wanted to develop a community that I would rely on in school. From that organization, it was evident that being by Black at the University of California, Riverside, I would not see a lot of “me” walking around the school or even in my classes. I lacked witnessing the equal representation of my community which gave me a stronger connection to opportunities that allowed me to engage with other Black people, like the BSU. Additionally, I participated in the UC Organizing Summit, which provided students with tools and resources to advocate for change in policy and a voice throughout the various University of California schools. FInally, I was a member of the programming committee of an organization called, Golden Arches. This organization aimed to teach folks across campus about the importance of sexual health and several other public health concerns. I was in charge of creating and executing several presentations and events. 
<br><br>

        Currently, I work as an after-school instructor for a STEM program in the neighboring district of my University. In this position, I work with students, families, and other staff to monitor and mentor students, daily after-school. I do this by developing curriculum, teaching and tutoring students, facilitating activities and more. With this program, I have connected with several people that work hard to make schools a better place. Moreover, this program allows me to give back to families and provide them with resources to help support them and their children in whatever way I can. The fulfilling nature of this job has made it one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had.
